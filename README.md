# ProgrammingChallenge1

1)Initialized BlockingQueue for posting random numbers and Result Message(One for Storing Integers, another for Storing String Result)
2)Randomizer is to generate random numbers.
3)PrimeRandamizer will check the generated random number is prime or not
4)Initialized Randamizer and PrimeRandamizer
5)Start thread on both classes. So run method will executed.
6)Randamizer run method add number into blocking queue.
7)PrimeRandamizer run method check whether number is prime or not and add result String to Blocking queue
8)Randamizer run method show result to console

Sample Output:
Checking with Random numbers from 1-100 whether Prime or not 
Random Number is : 62	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 27	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 50	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 66	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 6	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 55	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 5	 Is it Prime number : true
Random Number is : 90	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 20	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 57	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 38	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 54	 Is it Prime number : false
Random Number is : 83	 Is it Prime number : true
